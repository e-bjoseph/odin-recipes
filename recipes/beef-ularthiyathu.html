    <p>This way of cooking beef is very popular among the Syrian Christian community of Kerala. 
        However, every household has their own Beef Fry recipe or method of preparing Beef Fry. </p>

    <p>My mum-in-law shared this recipe with me many years ago ever since this is my go-to recipe
        without much alteration. </p>
        
    <p>Basically, beef is pressure cooked with spices, until tender. This cooked meat is slow roasted
        in a pan on low flame until nice and brown. The highlight of this recipe is the Dry Roasted 
        Masala and the addition of fried Coconut Bites.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>800gms Beef</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Coriander powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp chili powder</li>

        <li>2 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>2 tsp pepper powder</li>

    </ul>

        <li>Stir the gravy occasionally while cooking, to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan.</li>
