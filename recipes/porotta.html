    <p>Kerala Parotta or Malabar Parotta is a layered Indian flatbread that goes great with curries. Here is how to make it in a traditional way from scratch. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cup refined flour (maida)</li>
        <li>4 tbsp ghee</li>
        <li>1 egg </li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>water as required</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a wide bowl,take the maida, salt, sugar and 1tbsp of oil. Mix well to spread the oil in the flour. Now add water little by little and make a slightly sticky dough( Not too sticky).Knead well for 5 minutes. Grease your hands with a drop of oil while kneading. Apply 1.5 tsp of oil all over the dough and keep it covered for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 15 minutes, dough would be soft and non-sticky. Take the dough and make 3 golf sized balls.</li>
        <li>Take one ball and flatten it as much as possible using a rolling pin on a greased wide board or kitchen counter.The dough should be elastic and spread it as thin & transparent as possible.Apply little oil all over the parotta while rolling.Do it whenever needed.( Never use maida for dusting.Only oil should be used)</li>
        <li>Now pull one edge, move slightly forward and fold it. Do it like saree pleats. Please refer video for folding the parotta. After making pleats, just stretch it & roll them. If u find it difficult to do this, you can cut the rolled parotta into thin strips and place it one over the other. Roll it and make parotta.</li>
        <li>After rolling and folding,give a resting time of 5 minutes.In the mean time,u can fold the other two balls.Now take the rolled ball,grease it with oil and roll it using a rolling pin.Do not use ur hands to flatten it.Layers may suppress.Do not roll it too thin.Grease with oil whenever needed.Roll it thick like stuffed paratha because thick parotta tastes soft.Thin ones will become crispy while cooking.</li>
        <li>Heat an iron dosa pan ( It works best) and put the parotta. When u put it, the parotta may shrink. So spread it using your hands on the tawa carefully. Now drizzle 1/2 tsp of oil around the parotta. Keep the flame medium. Keep flipping and pressing the parotta with dosa flipper on both sides till you see the golden brown spots. Take care,flame should be medium and parotta should cook slowly.</li>
        <li>Remove the parotta to the kitchen counter or the rolling board and using your hands,just press the sides forcefully when the parottas are hot.Do it like clapping the hands by keeping the parottas in between. This is the most important step to make it flaky.It helps to bring the layers out and make it soft. Stack the cooked parotta in a hot box/casserole. Serve hot with Parotta kurma or salna.</li>
    </ol>
